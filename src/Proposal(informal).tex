\title{Towards a Notion of Defeasibility in Formal Concept Analysis}

\section{Introduction}
\section{The Initial Case}
\subsection{A Defeasible Formal Context} 
We define a defeasible formal context a $\K := (G,M,I,<)$ where $G$ is a set of objects, $M$ a set of attributes, $I$ an incidence relation on $G \times M$ expressed as $gIm$ for $g\in G, m\in M$ (exactly as we see with typical formal contexts); and, $<$ a strict partial order over $G$. 

\subsection{The Derivation Operators}
Over the defeasible formal context $\K = (G,M,I,<)$ we introduce two operators; $(\underlinesymbol{X}^\circ)$ and $\DCl{X}$, $X\subseteq M$. Before we define these operators, we introduce a definition of minimality over objects in $G$. 

\begin{align}
  Min(A) := \{g \in A | \nexists h \in A, h < g\} 
\end{align}

We can now define the respective operators, $A \subseteq G, B\subseteq M$. 

\begin{align}
  \underlinesymbol{A}^\circ &:= \{m \in M | \forall g \in Min(A), gIm\} \\ 
  \underlinesymbol{B}^\circ &:= \{g \in G | \forall m \in B, \nexists h \in G h < g, gIm  \}
\end{align}

(1) Describes the minimally ranked objects in $G$. From here, (2) describes an operation from a set of objects $A \subseteq G$ to the attributes shared by the minimal elements in $A$. (3) Is an operation from a set of attributes $B\subseteq M$ which results in the \textit{minimal} set of objects which have all the attributes in $B$. 

We can apply these operators twice, $\DCl{B}$ where $A\subseteq M$; this procedure would give the set of attributes shared by the minimal objects which satisfy the properties $B$. Conversely, $\DCl{A}$ where $A\subseteq G$ describes the minimal set of objects whichs satisfy the properties satisfied by all the objects in $A$.  

For an example, consider the defeasible context $\K = \{G,M,I,<\}$, with $o_i < o_j$ if $i < j$ for all objects.

Given $A = \{m_2, m_3\}$, we have that $\underlinesymbol{A}^\circ = \{o_1\}$, and $\DCl{A} = \{m_1, m_2, m_4\}$. Conversely, given $B = \{o_3, o_4\}$, $\underlinesymbol{B}^\circ = \{m_2, m_3, m_4\}$, $\DCl{B} = \{o_3\}$.\footnote[1]{I acknowledge that this second example could just be replaced with $Min(B)$, I will think more about this. }

\subsubsection{Properties of $(\underlinesymbol{\cdot}^\circ)^\circ$}

\textbf{nonmonotonic:} $A \subseteq B \not \Rightarrow \DCl{A} \subseteq \DCl{B}$

Assume $\DCl{\cdot}$ were monotonic; then $A\subseteq B \Rightarrow \DCl{A} \subseteq \DCl{B}$.

From Figure~\ref{Figure:Initial Defeasible Formal Context}, if we take the oo-operation on $A_1 = \{m_1, m_2\}$, we get $\DCl{A_2} = \{o_1\}^\circ = \{m_1, m_2, m_4\}$. Then, on $A_2 = \{m_1, m_2, m_3\}$, we have $\DCl{A_2} = \{o_2\}^\circ = \{m_1, m_2, m_3\}$. Obviously, we have $A_1 \subseteq A_2$ but $\DCl{A_1} \not \subset \DCl{A_2}$. Thus, the oo-operator is nonmonotonic. 

\textbf{extensive:} $X \subseteq \DCl{X}$

Assume that $\DCl{\cdot}$ is not extensive; then, there exists some $X \not \subseteq \DCl{X}$. Let $Y\subseteq G$ such that $Y = \underlinesymbol{X}^\circ$. Then $\underlinesymbol{Y}^\circ$ is the set of properties shared by all minimal objects in $Y$ (this minimal requirement is redundant since all elements of $Y$ are minimal by construction). Observe that $\underlinesymbol{Y}^\circ \equiv \DCl{X}$. Since $X \not \subseteq \DCl{X}$, there must be some $y\in Y$ such that $y^\circ \cap X \not = X$. That is, there is some object in $Y$ which does not have all the attributes from $X$. However, this is a contradiction, since $y$ would not be in $Y$ since it is not the case that $\forall m \in X, yIm$ - which is our definition of $(\underlinesymbol{\cdot}^\circ)$. 


\textbf{idempotent:} $\DCl{A} = \DCl{\DCl{A}}$

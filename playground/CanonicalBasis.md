If M is a set, we call its elements the attributes. 

An implication between attributes in M, is a pair of subsets of M; denoted by A -> B. 
A subset T of M respects the implication A->B, if
    - A is not a subset of T or, 
    - B is a subset of T. 
    So, there exists an implication A->B, T is a subset of M which respects this implication if A is not a subset of T, or B is a subset of T.
